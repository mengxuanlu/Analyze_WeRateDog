# Analysis and Visualization for WeRateDog Twitter


We were given two datasets, a csv file called twitter_achive_enhanced, a tsv file called image_predictions.tsv. The third file, we
need to query by ourselves from Twitter API, which is also the goal of this project. In order to analyze the data, we also need to clean these three dataset and combine them together to a master dataset.
